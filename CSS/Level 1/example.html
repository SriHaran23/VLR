                    My best friend, Freddie, has three important qualities. First of all, Freddie is always ready for her fun. Sometimes we play Frisbee in the park. Sometimes we just sit around in my room, listening to music, and talking. Second, he is completely trustworthy. I can tell Freddie my deepest secrets, and he doesn't share them with anyone else. Third, Freddie understands mu moods. When I am angry, he tries to make me feel better. When I sad, he tries to comfort me. When I am happy, he is happy too. To sum up, mu best friend is fun to be with, trustworthy, and understanding even if he is just a dog.
